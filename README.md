# Data_Sci_repo

## What is this place
This is a repo where I organized my files for my MSEE work in data science as a field from University of Colorado at Bolder (online)

## why?
Two reasons, easy of access of my work (for grading ) and as a reference later in life

## warnings
I am not what you would call a great programmer, I attempt to use good coding guide lines, but practicality (such as MVP and speed of completion) will usually trump maintainability (I know bad, bad bad) So if you see something strange its either Iâ€™m under the wrong impression of how something should be or I prioritized SPEED of completion. SO be warned the code my be verbose and may not work.
