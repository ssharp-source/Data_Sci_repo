# Data_Sci_repo

## What is this place
This is a repo where I organized my files for my MSEE work in **Data Science as a Field** from University of Colorado at Bolder (online)

## why?
Two reasons, easy of access of my work (for grading ) and as a reference later in life.

## warnings
I am not what you would call a great (or good) programmer, I attempt to use good coding practices, but practicality focused (such as MVP and speed of completion) will usually trump maintainability (I know bad, bad, bad). If you see something strange, it's either: Iâ€™m under the wrong impression of how something should be or I prioritized SPEED of completion. SO be warned the code may be verbose and it may not work.
